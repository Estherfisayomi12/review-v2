            iWorder announces its first-ever writing workshop, the Art of
            Creation, led by Pelumi Salako Baba and PK Daami. The workshop is
            open to all writers of African residence aged between 18 and 25.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slots are very limited, as iWorder seeks a learning environment as
            intimate and closely-knitted as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Send your best fiction, prose poetry, poetry, and genre-defying work
            via the form down below.
          </p>

          <p class="main__stories--h2">Workshop Details</p>
          <p>
            The workshop will be held both online and in physical gatherings
            spontaneously over a span of two months. All physical meeting places
            will likewise be spontaneous but within the premises of Ile Ife,
            Osun state.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workshop will be limited to eight Nigerian writers selected on
            the basis of their submitted samples or excerpts. Students admitted
            into the workshop, especially non-Ife residents will have to cover
            accommodation and feeding themselves. Although, the iWorder team
            will offer a stipend and accommodation for two students who can
            prove their need for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="main__stories--h1"> Art of Creation</span> will focus
            on the discussion and critique of the participantsâ€™ writing as well
            as the study of the craft through reading, active writing, analysis,
            editing, and consultation.
